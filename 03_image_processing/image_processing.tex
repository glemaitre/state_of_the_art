\section{Image regularization framework} \label{sec:imaprocfra}

This section provides a review of the methods used in \acp{cad} in order to regularize input images. We start with pre-processing methods presented in Sect. \ref{subsec:preprocessing}, focusing mainly on the reduction of noise level and artefacts as well as standardization of \ac{si}. Sections \ref{subsec:segmentation} and \ref{subsec:registration} will be dedicated to segmentation methods, so that later methods only operate on the segmented prostate, and registration to align segmented images from different \ac{mri}-modalities in the same reference frame.
