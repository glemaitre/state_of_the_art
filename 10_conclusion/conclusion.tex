\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This review presented an overview and gave a staging of the research related to \ac{cad} development for \ac{cap} using multi-parametric \ac{mri} data. We aimed at providing background information regarding multi-parametric \ac{mri} imaging techniques. A work-flow describing the \ac{cad} stages were proposed. The methods used in the literature for each of this stage were reviewed. The results of the available \ac{cad} systems were briefly reviewed. Subsequently, an insight discussion were given to conclude this survey. Additionally, a multi-parametric dataset will be made available to the research community in order to provide some solutions to outcomes pointed out during the review.
