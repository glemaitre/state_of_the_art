\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This review has presented an overview and classification of the research related to \ac{cad} development for \ac{cap} using multi-parametric \ac{mri} data. We aimed at providing background information regarding multi-parametric \ac{mri} imaging techniques and a description of the work-flow in the different \ac{cad} stages. The methods used in the literature for each of these stages have been reviewed along with the available results of the \ac{cad} systems. Moreover, insight discussions and possible future research directions have also been given. Finally, a multi-parametric multi-vendor dataset has been made available to the research community in order to provide a standardised platform for \ac{cad} development and evaluation for \ac{cap} using multi-parametric \ac{mri}.
