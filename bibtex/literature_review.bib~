  abstract = {T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been widely used for
	pretreatment work-up for prostate cancer, but its accuracy for the
	detection and localization of prostate cancer is unsatisfactory.
	To improve the utility of MR imaging for diagnostic evaluation, various
	other techniques may be used. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced
	MR imaging allows an assessment of parameters that are useful for
	differentiating cancer from normal tissue. The advantages of this
	technique include the direct depiction of tumor vascularity and,
	possibly, obviation of an endorectal coil; however, there also are
	disadvantages, such as limited visibility of cancer in the transitional
	zone. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates the restriction of
	diffusion and the reduction of apparent diffusion coefficient values
	in cancerous tissue. This technique allows short acquisition time
	and provides high contrast resolution between cancer and normal tissue,
	but individual variability in apparent diffusion coefficient values
	may erode diagnostic performance. The accuracy of MR spectroscopy,
	which depicts a higher ratio of choline and creatine to citrate in
	cancerous tissue than in normal tissue, is generally accepted. The
	technique also allows detection of prostate cancer in the transitional
	zone. However, it requires a long acquisition time, does not directly
	depict the periprostatic area, and frequently is affected by artifacts.
	Thus, a comprehensive evaluation in which both functional and anatomic
	MR imaging techniques are used with an understanding of their particular
	advantages and disadvantages may help improve the accuracy of MR
	for detection and localization of prostate cancer.},

	field strengths. With imagers operating at 0.35 and 1.5 T, T2-based
	tissue-contrast images were needed for the demonstration of the internal
	anatomy of the prostate gland. The display of zonal anatomy was improved
	when continuous 0.5-cm slices were used. Evaluating sequential sections,
	the peripheral, central, and transition zones could be differentiated.
	The peripheral zone showed higher signal intensity than either the
	central or transition zone and was discerned in the coronal, sagittal,
	and transverse planes. The central zone was of low signal intensity
	and was well displayed in the coronal and sagittal planes. The central
	zone was seen in 31 of the 32 young men (aged 25-35 years) but in
	only eight of the 23 older men (aged 40 years and older). The transition
	zone had intrinsic MR parameters similar to the central zone, and
	the two could be distinguished from each other only by the knowledge
	of their respective anatomic location. The low-intensity transition
	zone blended with the periurethral glands and the preprostatic sphincter.
	The transition zone was of homogeneous low signal intensity in young
	men but varied in size and signal intensity in older men. Such a
	detailed display of the prostate zonal anatomy offers a unique potential
	for the evaluation of prostatic physiology and disease.}

  pages = {35--49},
  abstract = {Earlier morphologic studies of the prostate, though often extensive,
	have never systematically delineated its completed structure. Recent
	comprehensive analysis of 500 prostates has more precisely defined
	its anatomic composition, identifying previously undetected features
	and unsuspected complexities. Using a three-dimensional model, these
	structures and relationships are demonstrated. Four basic anatomic
	regions are described. The relationship of each to the urethra provides
	a central anatomic reference point. 1. The peripheral zone constitutes
	over 70% of the glandular prostate. It forms a disc of tissue whose
	ducts radiate laterally from the urethra lateral and distal to the
	verumontanum. Almost all carcinomas arise here. 2. The central zone
	constitutes 25% of the glandular prostate. Its ducts arise close
	to the ejaculatory duct orifices and follow these ducts proximally,
	branching laterally near the prostate base. Its lateral border fuses
	with the proximal peripheral zone border, completing in continuity
	with the peripheral zone, a full disc of secretory tissue oriented
	in a coronal plane. Marked histologic differences between central
	and peripheral zones suggest important biologic differences. 3. Preprostatic
	region. The urethral segment proximal to the verumontanum is kinked
	anteriorly at a 35-degree angle to the distal segment. No major ducts
	arise in the proximal segment, but the lateral rows of peripheral
	zone orifices continue. Duct development is aborted here, producing
	only a small transition zone and several tinier periurethral ducts.
	The development of these small ducts is possibly determined and limited
	by their intimate relationship to a periurethral smooth muscle sphincter
	that exists only proximal to the verumontanum. These small ducts
	in a restricted area are the exclusive site of nodular hyperplasia
	(BPH) origin. 4. The anterior fibromuscular stroma forms the entire
	anterior surface of the prostate as a thick, nonglandular apron,
	shielding from view the anterior surface of the three glandular regions.
	Its inseparable fusion to the glandular prostate has probably delayed
	recognition of the anatomic features described here.}

	gland is secondary to two major studies successively published by
	Gil Vernet in 1953 and by McNeal in 1968. In Gil Vernet's report,
	glandular tissue consists of a caudal gland, a cranial gland and
	a intermediate gland. These 3 glandular areas were defined according
	to the location of their glandular openings into the urethra. In
	McNeal's report, the urethra is taken as the primary anatomic reference
	point. The four glandular areas are best visualized by examination
	of the selected coronal plane of sections along the proximal and
	distal prostatic urethra. The peripheral zone is located posterolaterally,
	the central zone is located at the base, and the 2 lobes of the transition
	zone are located along the proximal urethra. Fibromuscular regions
	are concentrated anteromedially. Most of the anatomic regions are
	similar between the two models, however, in McNeal's model, accuracies
	concerning the boundaries of the central zone and transition zone
	ultimately make this model superior for the study of both the physiology
	and pathology of the prostate.}
