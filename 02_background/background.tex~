\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

This section provides an overview of \ac{cap} and its detection and diagnosis. We start with a summary of the prostate anatomy and a brief overview of different \acp{cap} in Sect. \ref{subsec:humpro} and \ref{subsec:procar}. Section \ref{subsubsec:curscr} discusses the current screening strategy for \ac{cap} and its drawbacks. \ac{mri} plays an important role in improving the current strategy and Sect \ref{subsubsec:mrimrsi} presents a more detailed description of \ac{mri} modalities. These different techniques are used as inputs to the \acs{cad} system which is discussed in Sect \ref{subsubsec:CAD}.

The prostate is an exocrine gland of the male reproductive system having an inverted pyramidal shape. It measures approximately three centimetres in height by two and half centimetres in depth and its weight is estimated to be between seven and sixteen grams for an adult (\cite{Leissner1979}). The prostate size increases at two distinct stages during physical development: initially at puberty to reach its normal size, then again after sixty years of age leading to \ac{bph} (\cite{Parfait2010}).

A zonal classification of the prostate, depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:anatomyProstateZone}, was suggested by McNeal (\cite{McNeal1981}). Subsequently, this categorization was widely accepted in the literature (cf., \cite{Hricak1987,Villers1991,Coakley2000,Parfait2010}) and is used in all medical examinations (e.g., biopsy, \ac{mri} screening). The classification is based on dividing the gland into three distinct regions: (i) \ac{cz} accounting for 20-25\% of the whole prostate gland, (ii) \ac{tz} standing for 5\% and (iii) \ac{pz} representing 70\%. In \ac{mri} images, tissues of \ac{cz} and \ac{tz} are difficult to distinguish and are usually merged into a common region, denominated \ac{cg}. As part of this classification, the prostate can be divided in three longitudinal portions depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:anatomyProstateSagittal}: (i) base, (ii) median gland and (iii) apex.

\subsection{Prostate carcinoma}\label{subsec:procar}

\ac{cap} was reported on a worldwide scale to be the second most frequently diagnosed cancer of men accounting for $13.6 \%$ (\cite{Ferlay2010}). Statistically, in 2008, the number of new diagnosed cases was estimated to be $899,000$ with no less than $258,100$ deaths (\cite{Ferlay2010}). In United States, aside from skin cancer, \ac{cap} was declared to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men, implying that approximately one in six men will be diagnosed with \ac{cap} during their lifetime and one in thirty-six will die from this disease causing \ac{cap} to be the second most common cause of cancer death among men (\cite{Siegel2013}, \cite{Society2013}).

Despite active research to determine the causes of prostate cancer, a fuzzy list of risk factors has arisen (\cite{Society2010}). The etiology was linked to the following factors (\cite{Society2010}): (i) family history (\cite{Giovannucci2007,Steinberg1990}), (ii) genetic factors (\cite{Freedman2006,Amundadottir2006,Agalliu2009}), (iii) race-ethnicity (\cite{Giovannucci2007,Hoffman2001}), (iv) diet (\cite{Giovannucci2007,Ma2009,Alexander2010}), (v) obesity (\cite{Giovannucci2007,Rodriguez2007}). This list of risk factors alone cannot be used to diagnose CaP and in this way, screening enables early detection and treatment.

\ac{cap} growth is characterized by two main types of evolution (\cite{Strum2005}): slow-growing tumours, accounting for up to 85 \% of all \acp{cap} (\cite{Lu-Yao2009}), progress slowly and usually stay confined to the prostate gland. For such cases, treatment can be substituted with active surveillance. In contrast, the second variant of \acp{cap} develops rapidly and metastasises from prostate gland to others organs, primarily the bones (\cite{Oster2013}). Bone metastases, being an incurable disease, significantly affects the morbidity and mortality rate (\cite{Ye2007}). Hence, the  results of the surveillance have to be trustworthy in order to distinguish aggressive from slow-growing \ac{cap}.

\ac{cap} is more likely to come into being in specific regions of the prostate. In that respect, around 70-80 \% of \acp{cap} originate in \ac{pz} whereas 10-20 \% in \ac{tz} (\cite{Carrol1987,McNeal1988,Stamey1998}). Only about 5 \% of \acp{cap} occur in \ac{cz} (\cite{McNeal1988,Cohen2008}). However, those cancers appear to be more aggressive and more likely to invade other organs due to its location (\cite{Cohen2008}).

\subsection{\ac{cap} screening and imaging techniques}

\subsubsection{Current \ac{cap} screening}\label{subsubsec:curscr}

Current \ac{cap} screening consists of three different stages. First, \ac{psa} control is performed to distinguish between low and high risk \ac{cap}. Then, for confirmation, samples are taken during prostate biopsy and finally analysed to evaluate the prognosis and the stage of \ac{cap}. In this section, we present a detailed description of the current screening as well as drawbacks.

Since its introduction in mid-1980s, \ac{psa} is widely used for \ac{cap} screening (\cite{Etzioni2002}). A higher-than-normal level of \ac{psa} can indicate an abnormality of the prostate either as a \ac{bph} or a cancer (\cite{Hoeks2011}). However, other factors can lead to an increased \ac{psa} level such as prostate infections, irritations, a recent ejaculation or a recent rectal examination (\cite{Parfait2010}). \ac{psa} can be found in the bloodstream in two different forms: free \ac{psa} (about 10\%), and linked to another protein (about 90\%). A level of \ac{psa} higher than 10 ng.mL$^{-1}$ is considered to be at risk (\cite{Parfait2010}). If the \ac{psa} level is between 10 ng.mL$^{-1}$ and 4 ng.mL$^{-1}$, the patient is considered as suspicious (\cite{Barentsz2012}). In that case, the ratio of free \ac{psa} to total \ac{psa} is computed; if the ratio is higher than 15\%, the case is considered as pathological (\cite{Parfait2010}).

\Iac{trus} biopsy is carried out for cases which are considered as pathological. At least six different samples are taken randomly from the right and left parts of three three different zones: apex, median and base. These samples are further evaluated using the Gleason grading system (\cite{Gleason1977}). The scoring scheme to characterize the biopsy sample is composed of five different patterns which correspond to grades ranging from 1 to 5. Higher grades are associated with poor prognosis (\cite{Epstein2005}). Then, in the Gleason system, two scores are assigned corresponding to (i) the grade of the most present tumour pattern, and (ii) the grade of the second most present tumour pattern (\cite{Epstein2005}). A higher \ac{gs} indicates a more aggressive tumour (\cite{Epstein2005}). Also, it should be noted that biopsy is an invasive procedure which can result in serious infection or urine retention (\cite{Hara2005,Chou2011}).

Although \ac{psa} screening has been shown to improve early detection of \ac{cap} (\cite{Chou2011}), its lack of reliability motivates further investigations using \ac{mri}-\ac{cad}. Two reliable studies, carried out in the United States (\cite{Andriole2009}) and in Europe (\cite{Schroeder2012, Hugosson2010}), have attempted to assess the impact of early detection of \ac{cap}, with diverging outcomes (\cite{Chou2011,Heidenreich2013}). The study carried out in Europe\footnote{The \ac{ersspc}  started in the 1990s in order to evaluate the effect of \ac{psa} screening on mortality rate.} concluded that \ac{psa} screening reduces CaP-related mortality by 21-44\% (\cite{Schroeder2012, Hugosson2010}), while the American\footnote{The \ac{plco} cancer screening trial is carried out in the United States and intends to ascertain the effects of screening on mortality rate.} trial found no such effect (\cite{Andriole2009}). However, both studies agree that \ac{psa} screening suffers from low specificity, with an estimated rate of 36 \% (\cite{Schroder2008}). Both studies also agree that over-treatment is an issue: decision making of regarding treatment is further complicated by difficulties in evaluating the aggressiveness and progression of \ac{cap} (\cite{Delpierre2013}). 

Hence, new screening methods should be developed with improved specificity of detection as well as more accurate risk assessment (aggressiveness and progression). Current research is focused on identifying new biological markers to replace \ac{psa}-based screening (\cite{Bourdoumis2010,Morgan2011,Brenner2013}). Until such research comes to fruition, these needs can be met through active-surveillance strategy using multi-parametric \ac{mri} techniques (\cite{Hoeks2011,Moore2013}). \ac{mri}-\acs{cad} system, which is an area of active research and forms the focus of this paper, can be incorporated into this screening strategy allowing a more systematic and rigorous follow-up.

Another weakness of the current screening strategy lies in the fact that \ac{trus} biopsy does not provide trustworthy results. Due to its ``blind'' nature, there is a chance of missing aggressive tumours or detect microfocal ``cancers'', which influences the aggressiveness-assessment procedure (\cite{Noguchi2001}). As a consequence, over-diagnosis is estimated at up to 30 \% (\cite{Haas2007}), while missed clinically significant \ac{cap} is estimated at up to 35 \% (\cite{Taira2010}). In an effort to solve both issues, alternative biopsy approaches have been explored. \ac{mri}/\ac{us}-guided biopsy has been shown to outperform standard \ac{trus} biopsy (\cite{Delongchamps2013}). There, multimodal \ac{mri} images are fused with \ac{us} images in order to improve localization and aggressiveness assessment to carry out biopsies. Human interaction plays a major role in biopsy sampling which can lead to low repeatability; by reducing potential human errors at this stage, the \acs{cad} framework can be used to improve repeatability of examination.

\ac{cap} detection and diagnosis benefits from the use of \acs{cad} and \ac{mri} techniques. In the following sections, these techniques will be presented in addition to an overview of \acs{cad} for \ac{cap}.

\subsubsection{Imaging techniques: \ac{mri} - \ac{mrsi}} \label{subsubsec:mrimrsi}

\ac{mri} provides promising imaging techniques to overcome the previous mentioned drawbacks. Unlike \ac{trus} biopsy, \ac{mri} examination is a non-invasive protocol and has been shown to be the most acuteness and harmless technique available currently (\cite{Turkbey2012}).
In this section, a review of the different \ac{mri} techniques developed for \ac{cap} detection and diagnosis will be presented. Features strengthening each modality will receive particular attention together with possible drawbacks of each modality. Commonly, these features are the theoretical founding principles to develop analytic tools and automatic algorithms. However, we refer the reader to Sect. \ref{subsec:featuredetection} to obtain more details about automatic feature detection methods since that they are part and parcel of \acs{cad} framework.

We refer the reader to Tab. \ref{tab:modmri} where an overview of the following discussion is given.

%T2W MRI
\item[$-$] \textbf{\textit{\ac{t2w} \ac{mri}:}} \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} was the first modality investigated and allowing to perform \ac{cap} diagnosis using \ac{mri} (\cite{Hricak1983}). Nowadays, radiologists make use of it for \ac{cap} detection, localization and staging purposes (\cite{Barentsz2012}). This imaging technique is well suited to render zonal anatomy of the prostate (\cite{Barentsz2012}). 

This sequence relies on setting a long \ac{tr}, reducing the T$_1$ effect in \ac{nmr} signal measured, and fixing the \ac{te} to enough long values in order to enhanced the T$_2$ effect of tissues. Thus, \ac{pz} and \ac{cg} tissues are well perceptible in these images. The first mentioned is characterized by an intermediate/high-\ac{si} while the second is depicted by a low-\ac{si} (\cite{Hricak1987}). An example of healthy prostate is shown in Fig. ({\color{red}Healthy CG-PZ}).

In \ac{pz}, \acp{cap} are synonymous with round or ill-defined low-SI masses as shown in Fig. ({\color{red}CaP in PZ}) (\cite{Hricak1983}). Nevertheless, detecting \ac{cap} in \ac{cg} is more challenging. In fact both tissues, \ac{cg} and \ac{cap} have a low-\ac{si} in \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} reinforcing difficulties to distinguish between them. However, \acp{cap} in \ac{cg} are often shown as homogeneous mass possessing ill-defined edges with lenticular or ``water-drop'' shapes as depicted in Fig. ({\color{red}CaP in CG)} (\cite{Akin2006, Barentsz2012}). 

\ac{cap} aggressiveness was shown to be correlated with \ac{si}. Indeed, \acp{cap} assessed with a \ac{gs} of 4-5 implied lower \ac{si} than the one with a \ac{gs} of 2-3 (\cite{Wang2008}).

In spite of the availability of these useful and encouraging features, \ac{t2w} modality lacks of reliability (\cite{Kirkham2006,Hoeks2011}). Sensitivity is affected by the difficulties to detect cancers in \ac{cg} (\cite{Kirkham2006}) while specificity rate is highly affected by outliers (\cite{Barentsz2012}). In fact, various conditions emulate patterns of \ac{cap} such as \ac{bph}, post-biopsy haemorrhage, atrophy, scars and post-treatment (\cite{Hricak1987,Quint1991,Scheidler1999,Cruz2002,Barentsz2012}). These issues can be partly clear up thanks to more innovative and advanced modalities.

%T2 Map
\item[$-$] \textbf{\textit{T$_2$ Map:}} As previously mentioned, \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} modality lacks in sensitivity. Moreover, \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} images are a composite of multiple effects (\cite{Hegde2013}). However, T$_2$ values alone has been shown to be more discriminative (\cite{Liu2011}) and highly correlated with citrate concentration recognized as biological marker in \ac{cap} (\cite{Liney1996,Liney1997}). 

T$_2$ values are computed using the characteristics of transverse relaxation. Transverse relaxation is formalized as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:tramag}.

\begin{equation}
	M_{x,y}(t) = M_{x,y}(0) \exp \left( - \frac{t}{\text{T}_2} \right) \ .
	\label{eq:tramag}
\end{equation}

where $M_{x,y}(0)$ is the initial value of $M_{x,y}(t)$ and T$_2$ is the relaxation time.

By rearranging Eq. \ref{eq:tramag}, T$_2$ map is computed performing a linear fitting on the model in Eq. \ref{eq:t2map} using several TE such as $t=\{ \text{TE}_1,\text{TE}_2, \dotsc ,\text{TE}_m \}$.

\begin{equation}
	\ln \left[ \frac{M_{x,y}(t)}{M_{x,y}(0)} \right] = - \frac{t}{\text{T}_2} \ .
	\label{eq:t2map}
\end{equation}

\Ac{fse} sequence has been shown to be particularly well suited in order to build T$_2$ map and obtain accurate T$_2$ values (\cite{Liney1996a}).

Such as \ac{t2w} \ac{mri}, T$_2$ values associated with \ac{cap} are significantly lower than the one in healthy tissues (\cite{Liney1996,Gibbs2001}). {\color{red}Add figures.}

%DCE MRI
\item[$-$] \textbf{\textit{\ac{dce} \ac{mri}:}} \ac{dce} \ac{mri} is an imaging technique exploiting the vascularity characteristic of tissues. Contrast media, usually gadolinium-based, is injected intravenously to the patient. The media extravasales from vessels to \ac{ees} and then released back into the vasculature before to be eliminated by the kidney (\cite{Gribbestad2005}). Furthermore, the diffusion speed of the contrast agent may vary due to several parameters: (i) the permeability of the micro-vessels, (ii) their surface area and (iii) the blood flow (\cite{Padhani2002}).

Healthy \ac{pz} is mainly made up of glandular tissue, around 70 \% (\cite{Choi2007}), which imply a reduced interstitial space restricting exchanges between vessels and \ac{ees} (\cite{Buckley2004,Niekerk2009}). Normal \ac{cg} has a more disorganised structure, composed of mainly fibrous tissue (\cite{Choi2007,Hoeks2011}) , which allows more easily the arrival of contrast agent in \ac{ees} (\cite{Niekerk2013}). To understand the difference between contrast media kinetic in malignant tumours and the two previous behaviours mentioned, one has to focus on the process known as angiogenesis (\cite{Carmeliet2000}). In order to ensure its growth, malignant tumour produces and releases angiogenic promoter substances (\cite{Carmeliet2000}). As a consequence, those molecules stimulate the creation of new vessels towards the tumour (\cite{Carmeliet2000}). However, those new vessel networks in tumours differ from the one present in healthy tissue (\cite{Gribbestad2005}). They are more porous due to the fact that their capillary walls have a large number of ``openings'' (\cite{Gribbestad2005,Choi2007}). In opposition to healthy cases, this increased vascular permeability will allow to raise contrast agent exchanges, in arrival and departure, between vessels and \ac{ees} (\cite{Verma2012}).

By making used of the previous aspects, \ac{dce} \ac{mri} is based on an acquisition of a set of \ac{t1w} \ac{mri} images over time. Gadolinium-based contrast agent shorten T$_1$ relaxation time enhancing contrast in \ac{t1w} \ac{mri} images. The aim is to post-analysed the pharmacokinetic of the contrast media concentration in prostate tissues (\cite{Verma2012}). The image analysis is carried out in two dimensions: (i) in spatial domain on a pixel-by-pixel basis and (ii) in time domain corresponding to the consecutive imaging acquisition performed with the MRI. Thus, for each spatial location, a signal linked to contrast media concentration is measured as shown in Fig. ({\color{red}
Add graphics with the three types of perfusion signals.}) (\cite{Tofts2010}). 

To sum up and bring together the previous remarks regarding medical aspects and signal theory, \acp{cap} are characterized by a signal having an earlier and faster enhancement and an earlier wash-out (see Fig. ({\color{red}As previously mentioned.})) (\cite{Verma2012}). Three different approaches exist to analyse those signals with an eye to tag them as corresponding to either normal or malignant tissues. Qualitative analysis is based on assessment of the signal shape (\cite{Hoeks2011}). Quantitative approaches consist in inferring pharmocokinetic parameter values (\cite{Tofts2010}). Those parameters are part of mathematical-pharmacokinetic models which are directly based on physiological exchanges between vessels and \ac{ees}. Several pharmacokinetic models were proposed such as Kety model (\cite{Kety1951}), Tofts model (\cite{Tofts1997}) and mixed models (\cite{Larsson1996,StLawrence1998}). The last family of methods mixed both approaches and are grouped together under the heading of semi-quantitative methods. They rely on shape characterization using mathematical modelling to extract a set of parameters such as wash-in gradient, wash-out, integral under the curve, maximum signal intensity, time-to-peak enhancement and start of enhancement (see Fig. ({\color{red}present some curve})) (\cite{Hoeks2011,Verma2012}). It was shown that semi-quantitative and quantitative methods improved localization of \ac{cap} when compared with qualitative methods (\cite{Rosenkrantz2013}) The reader can turn to Sect. \ref{subsubsec:fddce} to obtain full description of quantitative and semi-quantitative approaches. They are used as feature in \acs{cad} framework.

\ac{dce} \ac{mri} combined with \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} has shown to enhance sensitivity compared to \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} alone (\cite{Jager1997,Kim2005,Schlemmer2004,Zelhof2009}). Despite this fact, \ac{dce} \ac{mri} has given rise to some drawbacks. Due to its ``dynamic'' nature, patient motions occur during the image acquisition protocol leading to spatial misregistration between the image set (\cite{Verma2012}). Furthermore, it has been suggested that malignant tumours are difficult to distinguish from prostatitis located in \ac{pz} and \ac{bph} located in \ac{cg} (\cite{Hoeks2011,Verma2012}). These pair of tissues tend to have similar appearances. Latter studies show that \acp{cap} in \ac{cg} does not manifest every time in homogeneous fashion. Indeed, tumours in this zone can present both hypo-vascularization and hyper-vascularization explaining the challenge of \ac{cap} detection in \ac{cg} (\cite{Niekerk2013}).


%DWI MRI
\item[$-$] \textbf{\textit{\ac{dw} \ac{mri}:}} As previously mentioned in the introduction (see Sect. \ref{sec:introduction}), \ac{dw} \ac{mri} is the most recent MRI imaging technique developed aiming at \ac{cap} detection and diagnosis (\cite{Scheidler1999}). This modality exploits the variations of water molecules motion in different tissues (\cite{LeBihan1988,Koh2007}).

From a physiological point of view, the following facts can be claimed. On the one hand, \ac{pz}, as aforementioned, is mainly a glandular and tubular structure allowing water molecules to move freely (\cite{Choi2007,Hoeks2011}). On the other hand, \ac{cg} is made up from muscular or fibrous tissue causing the motion of the water molecules to be more constrained and heterogeneous than in \ac{pz} (\cite{Hoeks2011}). Then, \ac{cap} growth leads to the destruction of normal glandular structure and is associated with an increase of cellular density (\cite{Hoeks2011,Koh2007,Somford2008}). Furthermore, these both factors proved to be inversely correlated with water diffusion (\cite{Koh2007,Somford2008}): higher cellular density implies a restricted water diffusion. Thus, it involves that water diffusion in \ac{cap} will be more restricted than both healthy \ac{pz} and \ac{cg} (\cite{Koh2007,Hoeks2011}).

From the \ac{nmr} principle side, \ac{dw} \ac{mri} sequence produces contrasted images due to variation of water molecules motion. The method is based on the fact that signal in \ac{dw} \ac{mri} images was inversely correlated to the degree of random motion of water molecules (\cite{Huisman2003}). In fact, gradients are used in \ac{dw} \ac{mri} modality to encode spatial location of nuclei temporarily. Simplifying the problem at only one direction, a gradient is applied in that direction, dephasing of the spins of nuclei water. Hence, the spin phases vary along the gradient direction depending of the gradient intensity at those locations. Then, a second gradient takes place in order to cancel the spin dephasing. Thus, the immobile water molecules will be subject to the same gradient intensity as the initial one while moving water molecules will be subject to a different gradient intensity. Thus, spins of moving water molecules will stay dephased whereas spins of immobile water molecules will come back in phase. As a consequence, an higher degree of random motion results into a more significant signal loss whereas a lower degree of random motion is synonymous with lower signal loss (\cite{Huisman2003}). Under these conditions, the MRI signal measured is formalized as in Eq. \ref{eq:dif}.

\begin{equation}
	M_{x,y}\left(t,b\right) = M_{x,y}(0) \exp \left( - \frac{t}{\text{T}_2} \right) S_{\text{ADC}}(b) \ .
	\label{eq:t2dif}
\end{equation}

where $S_{\text{ADC}}$ is defined in Eq. \ref{eq:dif} and refer to signal drop due to diffusion effect.

\begin{equation}
	S_{\text{ADC}}(b) = \exp \left( -b \times \text{ADC} \right) \ .
	\label{eq:dif}
\end{equation}

where $\text{ADC}$ is the \ac{adc} and $b$ is the attenuation coefficient depending only of gradient pulses parameters: (i) gradient intensity and (ii) gradient duration (\cite{LeBihan1986}).

By using this formalism, image acquisition with a parameter $b=0$ s.mm$^{-2}$ is corresponding to a \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} acquisition. Then, increasing the attenuation coefficient $b$ (cf., increase gradient intensity and duration) enhances contrast in \ac{dw} \ac{mri} images.

To summarize, in \ac{dw} \ac{mri} images, \acp{cap} are characterized by high-\ac{si} compared to normal tissue in \ac{pz} and \ac{cg} (\cite{Barentsz2012}). However, some tissue in \ac{cg} can look alike \ac{cap} with higher \ac{si} (\cite{Barentsz2012}). {\color{red}Images and reference to theses images should be included here.}

Diagnosis using \ac{dw} \ac{mri} combined with \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} has shown significant improvement compared with \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} alone and provides highly contrasted images (\cite{Shimofusa2005,Padhani2011,Choi2007}). As drawbacks, this modality suffers from a poor spatial resolution and also of specificity due to false positive detection in \ac{mri} area (\cite{Choi2007}).

With an eye on eliminating the previous drawback, radiologists are extracting quantitative map from \ac{dw} \ac{mri}. This imaging technique is presented in the next section.

%ADC map
\item[$-$] \textbf{\textit{\ac{adc} Map:}} The \ac{nmr} signal measured for \ac{dw} \ac{mri} images is not only affected by the diffusion effect as it could be deduced from Eq. \ref{eq:t2dif}. However, the signal drop (see Eq. \ref{eq:dif}) is formalized such that the only variable is the acquisition parameter $b$, related to the gradient parameters (\cite{LeBihan1986}). By paying attention to Eq. \ref{eq:dif}, the \ac{adc} is considered as ``pure'' diffusion coefficient and can therefore be extracted to build a quantitative map.

From Eq. \ref{eq:t2dif}, it can be note that performing multiple acquisitions by only varying the parameter value $b$, will not have effect on the term  $M_{x,y}(0) \exp \left( - \frac{t}{\text{T}_2} \right)$ and only the term $S_{\text{ADC}}(b)$ will affect the measured signal $S(b)$. Thus, Eq. \ref{eq:t2dif} can be rewritten as in Eq. \ref{eq:t2adcrew}.

\begin{equation}
	S(b) = S_0 \exp \left( -b \times \text{ADC} \right) \ .
	\label{eq:t2adcrew}
\end{equation}

To compute the \ac{adc} map, a minimum of two acquisitions are necessary: (i) for $b_0=0$ s.mm$^{-2}$ where the measured signal measured is equal to $S_0$ and (ii) $b_1>0$ s.mm$^{-2}$ (typically $1000$ s.mm$^{-2}$) allowing to compute the \ac{adc} map using the Eq. \ref{eq:adcres1}.

\begin{equation}
	\text{ADC} = \frac{\ln \left( \cfrac{S_0}{S(b_1)} \right) }{b_1} \ .
	\label{eq:adcres1}
\end{equation}

More accurate computation of the \ac{adc} map can be obtained by performing several acquisitions with different values for the parameter $b$ and performing a semi-logarithmic linear fitting using the model presented in Eq. \ref{eq:t2adcrew}.

Regarding the appearance of the \ac{adc} maps, it was previously mentioned that by increasing the value of $b$, signal of \ac{cap} tissue increases significantly. Furthermore, concentrating in Eq. \ref{eq:adcres1}, it can be deduced that tissue appearance in ADC map will be the reverse of \ac{dw} \ac{mri} images. Then, \ac{cap} tissue is synonymous with low-\ac{si} whereas healthy tissue appears brighter (\cite{Barentsz2012}). {\color{red}Add the some figures and references to the figures.} 

As \ac{dw} \ac{mri}, diagnosis using \ac{adc} map combined with \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} improved significantly compared to \ac{t2w} \ac{mri} alone (\cite{Doo2012,Choi2007}). Moreover, it has been shown that \ac{adc} is correlated with \ac{gs} (\cite{Hambrock2011, Itou2011, Peng2013}).

However, some tissues of the \ac{cg} zone mimic \ac{cap} with low-\ac{si} (\cite{Kirkham2006}). Image distortion can arise due to haemorrhage (\cite{Choi2007}). It has also been note that high variation of the \ac{adc} was occurring between patients (\cite{Choi2007}). 

%MRSI
\item[$-$] \textbf{\textit{\ac{mrsi}:}} \ac{cap} induces metabolism changes in prostate when compared with healthy tissue. Thus, \ac{cap} detection can be carried out by tracking changes of metabolite concentration in prostate tissue. \ac{mrsi} is an \ac{nmr}-based technique allowing to generate spectra of relative metabolite concentration in \iac{roi}.

In order to track changes of metabolite concentration, it is important to know which metabolites is associated with \ac{cap}. For that matter, clinical studies identified three biological markers: (i) citrate, (ii) choline and (iii) polyamines composed mainly of spermine, and in less abundance of spermidine and putrescine (\cite{Awwad2012,Costello2006,Giskeodegard2013}). 

Citrate is involved in the production and secretion of prostatic fluid, and glandular prostate cells are associated with high production of citrate enabled by zinc accumulation by these same cells (\cite{Costello2006}). However, the metabolism allowing the accumulation of citrate is not energy-efficient (\cite{Costello2006}). In contrast, malignant cells does not have high zinc levels leading to a lower citrate levels due to citrate oxydation (\cite{Costello2006}). Furthermore, this change results in a more energy-efficient metabolism enabling malignant cells to grow and spread (\cite{Costello2006}).

\ac{cap} is synonymous with an increased concentration of choline (\cite{Awwad2012}). Malignant cell development required epigenetic mechanisms resulting in metabolism changes. Malignant cell development relied on two mechanisms, DNA methylation and phospholid metabolism which are both resulting in choline uptake explaining its increased level in \ac{cap} tissue (\cite{Awwad2012}).

Spermine is also considered as biological marker in \ac{cap} (\cite{Graaf2000,Giskeodegard2013}). In \ac{cap}, reduction of the ductal volume due to shifts in polyamine homeostasis concomitant might lead to a reduced spermine concentration (\cite{Graaf2000}).

With an eye to determine the concentration of these biological markers, one has to focus on \ac{mrsi} modality. In theory, in presence of an homogeneous magnetic field, identical nuclei precesses at the same operating frequency known as the Lamor frequency (\cite{Haacke1999}). However, \ac{mrsi} is based on the fact that identical nuclei will slightly precess at different frequencies depending on the chemical environment where they are immersed in (\cite{Haacke1999}). This phenomena is known as the \ac{cse} (\cite{Parfait2010}). Given this property, metabolites can be identified and there concentrations can be determined. In this regard, the Fourier transform is used to obtain the frequency spectrum of the \ac{nmr} signal (\cite{Haacke1999,Parfait2010}). In this spectrum, each peak is associated to a particular metabolite and the area under each peak corresponds to the relative concentration of this metabolite (see Fig. {\color{red}Image with a spectrum}) (\cite{Parfait2010}).

Hence, frequencies of interest in regard to \ac{cap} detection and diagnosis should correspond to the earlier mentioned metabolites. Choline and spermine are represented by a single peak at respectively 3.21 ppm and 3.11 ppm (\cite{Lemaitre2011}). Due to the coupling effect, citrate is represented by three or four peaks depending of the magnetic field strength. Citrate is ranging from 2.47 ppm to 2.81 ppm with a central frequency at 2.64 ppm (\cite{Lemaitre2011}). Then, relative concentrations of these metabolites is computing the integral of the spectrum between the peak lower and upper frequency limits.

Two different quantitative approaches are used to take decision if a spectra of \iac{roi} is associated with \ac{cap} (\cite{Lemaitre2011}). In relative quantification, the ratio of choline-polyamines-creatine to citrate is computed. Integration of the signal from choline (cf., 3.21 ppm) to creatine (cf., 3.02 ppm) is calculated because peaks in this frequency area are difficult to differentiate and can be slightly merged, at clinical magnetic field strengths (\cite{Hoeks2011,Graaf2000}). Considering the previous assumption that choline concentration rises and citrate concentration decreases in presence of \ac{cap}, the ratio computed should be higher in  malignant tissue than healthy tissue. In contradiction with relative quantification, absolute quantification allows to express concentrations in moles by normalizing relative concentrations using water as reference (\cite{Lemaitre2011}). In this case, ``true'' concentrations are directly used to differentiate malignant from healthy tissue base on the previous statement. However, this method is not commonly used due to extra time spent to acquire the water signals.

\ac{mrsi} allow examination with high specificity and sensitivity compared to others \ac{mri} modalities (\cite{Choi2007}). Furthermore, combining \ac{mrsi} with \ac{mri} improves detection and diagnosis performance (\cite{Scheidler1999a,Kaji1998}). Citrate and spermine concentration shown to be inversely correlated with the \ac{gs} allowing to distinguish low from high grade \acp{cap} (\cite{Giskeodegard2013}). However, choline concentration does not seem to provide the same properties (\cite{Giskeodegard2013}).

Unfortunately, \ac{mrsi} presents also several drawbacks. First, \ac{mrsi} acquisition is time consuming which making this modality optional in some hospitals (\cite{Barentsz2012}). Then, \ac{mrsi} suffers from low spatial resolution due to the fact that \ac{snr} is linked to the voxel size. However, this issue is addressed by developing new scanner with higher magnetic field strengths (\cite{Giskeodegard2013}). Finally, high variability of the relative concentrations between patients was observed (\cite{Choi2007}). The same observation was made depending of the zones studied (cf., \ac{pz}, \ac{cg}, base, mid-gland, apex) (\cite{Walker2010,Lemaitre2011}). Due to this variability, it is difficult to create rigid threshold in order to differentiate \ac{cap} from healthy tissue.
