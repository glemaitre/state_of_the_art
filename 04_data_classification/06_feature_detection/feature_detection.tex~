\subsection{The human prostate}

\subsection{Prostate carcinoma}

Prostate cancer (CaP) was reported, at a worldwide scale, to be the second most frequently diagnosed cancer of men accounting for $13.6 \%$ (\cite{Ferlay2010}). Statistical estimation stated about $899,000$ new diagnosed cases and no less than $258,100$ deaths in 2008 (\cite{Ferlay2010}). In United States, aside of skin cancer, CaP was declared to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men implying that approximately one in six men will be diagnosed with CaP during their lifetime and one in thirty-six will die from this disease entailing CaP to be the second most common cause of cancer death among men (\cite{Siegel2013}, \cite{Society2013}).
